The 'Add a comment...' input should be wrapped in a <form></form> element. 
Using that form's onSubmit event handler, invoke the addNewComment function and pass it the 
required arguments it needs to add a new comment.
Update your state with the new comment
(This should trigger your component tree to "re-render" with 
your new comment on that post).
